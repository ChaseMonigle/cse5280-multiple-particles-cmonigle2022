Question: (Task4)
1. How does directional dependence affect the symmetry of the social force field?
In the isotropic models, the force only depends on distance, so it is symmetric around each particle. 
This means particles push away from each other equally in all directions. In the anisotropic model, the 
force also depends on the direction of motion. Because of this, particles react more strongly to other 
particles in front of them than behind them. This breaks the symmetry and makes the motion more directional.

2. Does the anisotropic model reduce oscillations or deadlocks? Why?
Yes, the anisotropic model reduces oscillations. In the isotropic case, particles can push each other back an
d forth because the force is the same in every direction. This can cause small bouncing or hesitation. In the 
anisotropic model, particles mainly care about what is in front of them, so they don’t overreact to particles behind them.
This makes the motion smoother and reduces back-and-forth behavior.

3. How does each model behave in narrow corridors or near bottlenecks?
In narrow spaces, the isotropic model can cause particles to crowd and push equally from all sides
, which may slow things down. The anisotropic model handles this better because particles focus more on forward movement
. This allows them to flow toward the goal in a more organized way and reduces congestion.


4. What trade-offs arise when introducing velocity-dependent interactions?
The anisotropic model produces more realistic and stable motion, but it adds more complexity. 
It depends on velocity, so if particles are moving very slowly, the directional effect is weaker. 
It also introduces an extra parameter (β), which needs to be tuned. The isotropic model is simpler
and easier to implement, but it can behave less realistically in crowded situations.
